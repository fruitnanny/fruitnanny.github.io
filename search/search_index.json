Connect Raspberry to host \u00b6 All further commands will be executed via ssh directly on the Raspberry. For this, the host computer needs to connect the Raspberry. There are two options: Either you have connect it with your wired local network and let the router assign an IP address to the Raspberry via DHCP. Connect the Raspberry directly via Ethernet to the host and \"share\" the Internet connection. This can be done easily from within NetworkManager. The following command can be used to create shared connection from the command line. Note Replace the interface name (ifname) eno1 with the name of the ethernet interface that will be connected to the Raspberry Pi. The interfaces can be inspected with ip addr . # Create shared Ethernet connection via NetworkManager nmcli connection add \\ con-name \"Raspberry Pi\" \\ type ethernet \\ ipv4.method shared \\ ipv4.addresses 10 .43.0.1/24 \\ ifname eno1 Note The IP address can queries via mDNS with the hostname raspberry.local . Ensure that mDNS is available on your system, either via Avahi or systemd-resolve. After figering out the connection method, insert the SD card into the Raspberry and boot the device. ssh pi@raspberrypi.local The default Raspbian password is raspberry . SSH Public Key Authentication \u00b6 The first action will be to replace the default SSH password with proper public key authentication. Copy your public SSH key to the Raspberry: # Executed on the host machine. Copies the public SSH key to the Raspberry ssh-copy-id pi@raspberrypi.local # Now, you can connect the the Raspberry without password ssh pi@raspberrypi.local # Executed on the Raspberry Pi. Deletes the password of the user \"pi\". sudo passwd --delete pi All further setup steps are performed on the Raspberry Pi. Audio Device Setup \u00b6 The Linux audio subsystem of the WebRTC native code package searches all available audio device. The USB microphone should be the first in this list. For that reason, we disable the in the device tree via device tree and rearrange the USB audio driver kernel driver load order. # Disable raspberry audio sudo sed -i \"s/^dtparam=audio=on/# dtparam=audio=on # disabled for rpi-webrtc-streamer/\" \\ /boot/config.txt # Reorder USB audio device index sudo sed -i \"s/^options snd-usb-audio index=-2/# options snd-usb-audio index=-2 # disabled for rpi-webrtc-streamer/\" \\ /lib/modprobe.d/aliases.conf The gain of the microphone is increased to be more sensitive. We can either use alsamixer ( F4 Capture ) or set the gain directly via command line: Note 23.81 dB (100%) might be too senstive. Choose the value that fits best your needs. # Set the gain of the USB microphone to 100% sudo amixer set 'Mic' ,0 100 % Disable Bluetooth \u00b6 Currently, FruitNanny does not use Bluetooth. In order to save power, we are going to disable the Bluetooth chip via device tree and disable all related services. # Disable Bluetooth via device tree echo -e \"\\n# Disable Bluetooth\\ndtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt\\n\" \\ | sudo tee -a /boot/config.txt # Disable Bluetooth-related services sudo systemctl disable hciuart.service bluealsa.service bluetooth.service Enable DHT11 kernel driver \u00b6 The Linux kernel contains a in-kernel driver for DHT11/21/22 devices.

It will blink in a fixed period signalling that the device is still up and running. # Load LED heartbeat kernel module sudo modprobe ledtrig-heartbeat # Enable heartbeat for activity LED echo heartbeat | sudo tee /sys/class/leds/led0/trigger Install NetworkManager \u00b6 FruitNanny uses NetworkManager to control the WiFi networking via its DBus interface. # Remove default Raspbian DHCP client sudo apt-get remove dhcpcd5 # Install NetworkManager sudo apt-get install network-manager Change Hostname \u00b6 FruitNanny web service will be available under the mDNS hostname fruitnanny.local . The standard Raspbian hostname raspberry will be replaced by fruitnanny . Note If you prefer a different hostname, adjust it to your liking. The hostname is not hard coded in the web UI and should work out-of-the box. # Change hostname sudo hostnamectl set-hostname fruitnanny # Resolve new hostname to localhost echo -e \"127.0.1.1\\t $( hostname ) \\n\" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts Enable Camera \u00b6 Use raspi-config to enable the camera under 5 Interfacing Options \u2013 P1 Camera . sudo raspi-config Restart the Device \u00b6 Now, reboot the device for all changes to take effect. The device is available via the hostname fruitnanny.local (or what ever was chosen as new hostname). # Reboot the device sudo reboot # Connect to the device via the new hostname ssh pi@fruitnanny.local The NetworkManager setup can be verified by running nmcli .

The FruitNanny is essentially a Raspberry Pi with a NoIR camera, microphone and environmental sensor. It is accessed by a web UI via WiFi at fruitnanny.local .

If your system is not listed here, these are the required technologies: mDNS support in order to resolve *.local domains in a local network Browser with WebRTC and H.264 codec support for live video streaming. Supported Platform Browser Notes \u2713 Ubuntu Firefox, Chromium Avahi for mDNS support. \u2713 iOS Safari \u2713 Android Firefox Preview mDNS does not work on Android. Use IP address instead, see this section . \u2717 Android Firefox Since version 68 Firefox for Android no longer supports H.264 due to a change in Google Play policy . (?) Android Chrome On Android WebRTC, H.264 is supported only if: device hardware supports it and WebRTC hardware encoder glue logic supports that hardware encoder. Currently only Qualcomm and Exynos devices are supported. Any other devices \u2013 even if they support H.264 hardware encoder \u2013 will not be used and will not be available for WebRTC streams. See here for more information. \u2713 Windows Chrome Chrome has built-in support for mDNS. \u2717 Windows Firefox Currently, Firefox does not support the new mDNS API of in Windows 10. First Steps \u00b6 1. Power \u00b6 Connect the FruitNanny to a 5V microUSB power source . A powerbank should also do the trick and provides mobility. As soon as the FruitNanny is powered, it will boot up. 2. Connect to WiFi Hotspot \u00b6 If the FruitNanny does not find any known WiFi network, it starts its WiFi Hotspot . Its default SSID is FruitNanny . Connect to the WiFi to get access to the web UI. 3. Access Web UI \u00b6 Once you are connected to the hotspot, the web UI can be accessed via http://fruitnanny.local/ . Note .local are mDNS domain names. The system and/or browser needs to support this technology. It is a well known issue that mDNS does not work properly on Android. Please consult the support matrix . Hit the Play button and you should get a live video. If it is dark, just turn on the infrared light. Only one device can use the live stream at the same time. See this issue for explanation. If you want to connect the FruitNanny to your home network instead of using the hotspot, please check the network configuration section . 4. Powering Off \u00b6 The FruitNanny can be turned off via the main menu in the top left corner. Of course, you could also just unplug the FruitNanny but this should be avoided in order to properly shut down the operating system.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"user/getting-started/#support-matrix","text":"This is a list of platforms and browsers known to work.
