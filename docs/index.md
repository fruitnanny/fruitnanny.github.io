FruitNanny is a completely over-engineered do-it-yourself (DIY) open source NoIR baby monitor based on a
[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). Kudos to [Dmitry Ivanov](https://github.com/ivadim/fruitnanny)
who had the [original project idea](https://ivadim.github.io/2017-08-21-fruitnanny/).
